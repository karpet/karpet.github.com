<h3>Summary</h3>
<div class="indent">
<p>
I have over two decades of experience solving technical problems within non-profit, for-profit and government organizations. I have been responsible for information architectures, APIs, data analysis and design, system administration, infrastructure, testing and release automation, search engines, web development, software engineering and technical support. I have led, interviewed, and hired engineering teams, and managed budgets. I have fixed broken systems at 2 a.m. and counseled C-suite executives making strategic decisions.
</p>
<p>I specialize in making complex technical subjects lucid to non-technical people.</p>
<p>I actively seek opportunities for mission-oriented work using and promoting open source software.</p>
<p>Based in Kansas, I have decades of remote work experience with distributed teams across multiple timezones. My co-workers and employers most often comment on the high quality and pace of my efforts.</p>
