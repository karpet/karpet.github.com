      <h3>Summary</h3>
      <div>
        <p>I have over two decades of experience solving technical
        problems within non-profit, for-profit and government
        organizations. I have been responsible for all aspects of
        development, from designing and building software systems
        to managing teams and budgets.</p>
        <p>My chief technical interests include security and
        privacy, identity management, APIs, geospatial
        presentation, data analysis and design, scaling highly
        reliable systems, and information retrieval. I have hired
        and led engineering teams, rescued broken systems at 2 a.m.
        and counseled C-suite executives making strategic
        decisions.</p>
        <p>I specialize in making complex technical subjects lucid
        to non-technical people.</p>
        <p>I actively seek opportunities for mission-oriented work
        using and promoting open source software.</p>
        <p>Based in Kansas, I have decades of remote work
        experience with distributed teams across multiple
        timezones. My co-workers and employers most often comment
        on the high quality and pace of my efforts.</p>
